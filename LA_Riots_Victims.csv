Aguilar, a Honduran immigrant, was arrested with more than 40 other alleged looters near Sam's Corner Liquor Store at 6th Street and Westlake Avenue.  Officers say he was ordered to lie prone, and that he then pulled what appeared to be a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward them.
Officers fired at Aguilar with a 9-millimeter pistol and a shotgun. He was struck in the chest and died at the scene, according to an initial coroner's account.
The ""gun,"" however, was a plastic toy with a black barrel and brown grips, officials said.
Aguilar had lived for five months in the Park View Luxury Apartments, a $450-a-month hotel at MacArthur Park. Friends said he delivered newspapers for a living.
A father of two, Aguilar had planned to return to Honduras to be reunited with his pregnant girlfriend.
Aguilar's body was flown back to Honduras at that government's expense because Aguilar's family could not pay the $1,976, Consul General Rene Francisco Umana said.
""It's so sad,"" Umana said. ""Maybe he didn't have an idea to hurt anybody . . . but the situation was so difficult, so grave. In L.A., things can happen.""

He was taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, where he died.
Less than four hours after truck driver Reginald O. Denny and others were attacked at Florence and Normandie, four LAPD officers in a patrol car said they came under intense fire from looters outside a Korean American-owned store in Green Meadows at Central Avenue and 112th Street.
The officers returned fire and then sped off to await reinforcements. One of seven rounds they fired had hit a heavyset, shirtless gunman.
When they returned, the victim and his weapon had vanished. LAPD officials later learned that 17-year-old Harrison had died of a gunshot wound at the hospital, and ballistics tests showed that he had been struck by a 9-millimeter bullet fired by an LAPD officer.
Harrison was angry over the verdicts in the King beating case, relatives said, and had helped loot clothing stores earlier in the night.
But whether he was the shirtless suspect who shot at police is another question.
About 10:30 p.m., there was a soft knock on the door of an apartment Harrison's girlfriend shared with her mother, Myra Collins. It was Harrison, Collins said later, and he was wearing a blood-drenched T-shirt with a small bullet hole in the chest.
""It was just like when you watch these westerns and they stagger in the door,"" she said.
""I don't know what DeAndre was doing,"" Collins said. ""I don't know if he was an angel or a devil. But he did have on a white T-shirt.""
""He was just a kid that got caught up in a vicious cycle,"" said Verbum Dei High School Principal Robert Mendoza, who had known Harrison for years. ""It's very difficult to live around here.""",http://articles.latimes.com/print/1992-05-24/news/mn-378_1_police-officer,"DeAndre Harrison, a 17-year-old-black man, was fatally shot Thursday, April 30, 1992, near the intersection of Central Avenue and 112th Street in Green Meadows.

In October 1994, two Altadena teenagers, previously accused of the murder of Maronian, were given five years' probation on related charges. O'Dell Whitley Jr., 19, and Leonard Hampton, 18, were sentenced in Pasadena Superior Court for commercial burglary of an Arcadia sporting goods store and attempted robbery of a pedestrian.
The two originally were charged with a series of crimes that included the stabbing of Maronian.
In April 1993, Whitley and Hampton were found guilty of the lesser crimes. But a mistrial was declared on the murder charge when only four of the 12 jurors voted for conviction. The district attorney decided not to retry the two for murder.

",,"Aaron Ratinoff, a 68-year-old white man, died Friday, May 1, 1992, in the 11600 block of Gateway Boulevard in Sawtelle.  Ratinoff was strangled by a supermarket produce manager in a dispute over corn husks.
Ratinoff would never have ended up at the Bob's Market on Gateway Boulevard in West Los Angeles if the store where he normally shopped had remained open during the riots. The produce manager apparently got angry when Ratinoff dropped some corn husks on the floor while shopping for vegetables, and the pair tussled.

Tope was rescued by a passing ambulance, but he lapsed into a coma shortly after arriving at the hospital. 
Two men charged with murder in the last major case of the Los Angeles riots each pleaded no contest in the fatal beating of Tope and were sentenced to prison May 9, 1994.
Fidel Ortiz, 22, and Leonard Sosa, 24, both former warehouse workers for a Dodger Stadium concessionaire, entered the pleas to reduced charges of voluntary manslaughter on the same day they were to go on trial for the April 30, 1992, attack.
Under a plea agreement, the judge in the case sentenced Ortiz to an 11-year prison term and Sosa to a six-year term.
